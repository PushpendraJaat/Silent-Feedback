## Security Best Practices üîí

As a senior developer, I ensure that Silent Feedback adheres to industry-leading security standards:

- **CSRF Protection:**  
  CSRF tokens are implemented to safeguard against cross-site request forgery attacks.

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  All user inputs are carefully sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other injection-based vulnerabilities.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  API endpoints are protected with rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.

- **Secure Data Handling:**  
  Anonymous messages are processed securely without storing personally identifiable information; sensitive data is encrypted as needed.

- **Email Verification:**  
  User emails are verified using OTP via the Resend API, ensuring the integrity of user accounts.

- **Regular Audits & Monitoring:**  
  Continuous monitoring and security audits are performed to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
